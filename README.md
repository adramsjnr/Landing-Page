# Ancient Scrolls Club Landing Page

This is a single-page landing page for an Ancient Scrolls Club. The primary goal of this project was to practice foundational skills in HTML structure and CSS styling to create a compelling and visually appealing website.

## Project Overview

A main landing page (index.html) that introduces a book club for ancient texts. The page is organized into distinct sections: a hero section, an information section, a quote section, a call-to-action, and a footer. A single external stylesheet has beed used to apply all the styling consistently across the page.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have practiced:

-Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML tags.

-Organizing files by separating HTML and CSS into external files for a cleaner project structure.

-Applying external styling rules to control typography, color palettes, and overall visual design.

-Debugging common issues, such as fixing broken image paths or styling links, to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Reflection

This project was a great exercise in applying core concepts and building a complete, polished page.
