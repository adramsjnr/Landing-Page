# Ancient Scrolls Club Landing Page

This is a single-page landing page for a fictional "Ancient Scrolls Club." The primary goal of this project was to practice foundational skills in HTML structure and CSS styling to create a compelling and visually appealing website.

## Project Overview

A main landing page (index.html) that introduces a book club for ancient texts.
-The page is organized into distinct sections: a Hero Section, an Information Section, a Quote Section, a Call-to-Action, and a Footer.
-A single external stylesheet (style.css) is used to apply all the styling consistently across the page.
-The hero section includes a placeholder image to demonstrate proper image embedding.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have practiced:
-Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML tags  **('<header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>') **.
-Organizing files by separating HTML and CSS into external files for a cleaner project structure.
-Applying external styling rules to control typography, color palettes, and overall visual design.
-Debugging common issues, such as fixing broken image paths or styling links, to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Reflection

This project was a great exercise in applying core concepts and building a complete, polished page.
